# WHICH STATE HAS THE WORST DRIVER? 
## Sihan Lin

I got my data from Andrewflowers and Dmil's "bad-drivers" file on Github. The original data is already very organized. The data includes the percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions who were speeding, alcohol-impaired, were not distracted, had not been involved in any previous accidents. The data set also contains each state's number of drivers involved per billion, car insurance premiums, and losses incurred by insurance companies for collisions. I inserted the data to google spreadsheet and worked on it. Here is a [link](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/bad-drivers/bad-drivers.csv) to Andrewflowers and Dmil's .csv file.

On my sheet, I added a column of the total percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions who speeding and alcohol-impaired to the original data set. Here is the [link](https://github.com/Annnnnn777/link/blob/master/data.csv) to my .csv file.

Here is a [link](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GgfmL/1/) to my graph published on Datawrapper. You can move around your mouse to check out the data for those states that do not display on the previous graph. 

I find it very interesting that Hawaii has high percentages in both speeding and alcohol-impaired. However, it does not mean that Hawaii has the worst drivers because the graph and the data set only contain data about speeding and alcohol-impaired. The data set does not include other causes of accidents such as incorrect road use, technical faults, or physical or mental problems of drivers. 

### Geo Graph of Number of Drivers Involved in Fatal Collisions Per Billion

The states that have the most number of drivers involved in fatal collisions per billion are South Carolina and North Dakota which have 23.9 drivers. Closed behind are West Virginia and Arkansas, with data of 23.8 and 22.4. I wondered that whether high number of drivers involved in fatal collisions have relationship with the size of geography area. However, the graph I created did not show this relationship. 

I created several pivot tables and scatter charts, trying to see the relationship between drivers who had not been involved in any previous accidents and numbers of accident, speeding, and alcohol-impaired, but I found no relationship. Points are scattered in all graphs I created.
